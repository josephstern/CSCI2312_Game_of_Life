Hello Class, for your extra credit, I want you to Fork this repository (Be sure to keep it public so I can see it), clone the repository to your computer, comment as much as you can, and push to your forked repository. 

(If you need help with the above terminology, please refer to my 'Git Good' lecture, or email me)

Keep in mind the default CLion 'run' console won't work, as it doesn't properly clear the screen. Instead, make sure your build configuration is set to use an external console.


(Advanced) If you find a bug in my code that you think everyone would benefit from having fixed, try out making a pull request with your fixed code, and I'll apply it to this repository!

If the code isn't working on your machine, use the Issues tab to let me know. Be sure to include your build enviornment and what OS your running, as well as a description of the problem.
